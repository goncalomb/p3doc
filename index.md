## P3 CPU Introduction ##

The P3 is a 16-bit CPU used at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) (IST) as a learning tool for Computer Engineering students.

It is described in chapters 10, 11 and 12 of the book:

> Arquitectura de Computadores: Dos Sistemas Digitais aos Microprocessadores  
> G. Arroz, J. Monteiro, A. Oliveira  
> IST Press

Some official links (in Portuguese):

 * [Book Information](http://algos.inesc-id.pt/arq-comp/)
 * [P3 CPU assembler and simulator](http://algos.inesc-id.pt/arq-comp/?Material_Did%C3%A1tico___Processador_P3)
 * [Manual for the assembler and simulator](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/3779579934970/Manual_P3.pdf) ([alt](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/3779573897310/Manual_P3.pdf))

The P3 itself is not a commercial product and doesn't exist as a dedicated IC. It is normally implemented on an FPGA or simulated on a computer.

_Not to be confused with the Pentium III._
